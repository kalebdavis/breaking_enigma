\section{Encryption Process}

In accordance with Kerchoff's principle, the method of encrypting a message was known by the Polish and British cryptologists attempting to break the cipher. In this paper, we will touch on two (2) separate methods of encrypting a message that were used during World War II. The first method was common practice until September 1938, when Germany decided to increase security by changing to the second method, which was used from then on.
